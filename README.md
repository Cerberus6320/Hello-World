# Hello-World

Hello there,

I'm Matt, but online I go by Cerberus6320. I prefer to stay anonymous, but if I gave you a link to this, you probably know me or are looking through my code to figure out if I know anything about coding. Well, the short answer is yes, I started out trying to be a programmer around my Freshman year of high school. Since then, I've developed numerous projects in Java code, C#, and even programming on a TI-83.

One of the problems of showing you that I know my stuff is that I'm actually not able to use a lot of my old projects because most were created while I was employed, so it actually isn't my intellectual property to distrubute as I see fit.

Anyways, I'll be using this site to create some code. Hopefully, I'm able to do some pretty nifty things that will demonstrate my value as a programmer.
